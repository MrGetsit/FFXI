# BuffCheck

Simple multibox addon for detecting which buffs are missing from your characters. WIP

### Command Usage:
```
  bc pos x y  -- Set position of buff display //bc pos 10 100
  bc buff     -- Add or remove buff from watched list. Buffs are case senstive and based on the BUFF name not the SPELL name. 
              -- ie: Indi-Fury would be "Attack Boost" - Other buffs work as usual //bc Haste or //bc "Samurai Roll"
              -- Check buff name in buff window or Windower/Res/Buffs.lua for the full list
```
