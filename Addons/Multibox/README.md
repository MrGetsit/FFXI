Just to be clear, Im not a programmer. Smashing bits of code together from all over to make this thing run is a miracle it even works. Seems to run fine for me but your mileage may vary. Still a work in progress.

# Multibox

A simple multiboxing addon to get all characters to follow you and engage enemies when commanded. Also some other random functions that I keep adding in that should probably be removed at some point.

### Command Usage:
```
mb follow    -- All other nearby characters start to follow whichever character is active, will switch automatically to other characters if you switch to them
mb stop      -- All characters stop following
mb advance   -- All characters engage and move towards whatever enemy you have targeted
mb retreat   -- All characters GTFO and run away from whatever they are fighting

ctrl + enter to have all characters interact with whatever you have targeted

mb u -- Press up key on all characters
mb d -- Press down key on all characters
mb e -- Press enter on all characters
```
